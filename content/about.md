Hello Friends! My name is Lauren Gray! I am the wife to Tyler Gray, and expectant mom to our first little one, John Wylam, and I could definitely never write a bio without mentioning our fur babies, Fred and Eleanor. Here is just a little tidbit about me..

\*My husband and I live in an old Craftsman home that was built in 1914. We absolutely love the old charm and character!

\*I love winter and the snow, I am definitely more of a Fall & Winter person (which I know sounds insane since I live in Alabama where it is basically summer 9 months of the year)

\*I majored in Music (vocal performance) in college and have taught Elementary music, as well as private voice and piano for 5 years. I am a complete music nerd.

\*I love to travel but have never actually been oversees. My dream is to visit Europe and just see everything. Probably top of the list would be Ireland, Rome, and the French countryside.

\*Ok one more... My husband and I were both homeschooled.  Yes, we were those weird homeschool kids. We met randomly my senior year of high school in Walmart (yes you read that right), and the rest was history.

I love to create, maybe it's the middle child in me, I don't know, but I am always drawn to creativity. I love music, baking, decorating, designing, art etc.. so photography was a pretty natural step. I have always loved showcasing beauty through photography and it has been a true passion of mine since I was a kid. I just never dreamed that the Lord would open the opportunity to turn it into a career, but I am so happy that He did! 

My job as a photographer is not just to capture images, it is to freeze little moments in time, and to showcase its beauty and vibrancy. I am so honored to be a part of some of the happiest moments in other's lives and to capture those moments of joy for many years to come! I cannot wait to meet with you, hear your story, and begin this beautiful journey!
