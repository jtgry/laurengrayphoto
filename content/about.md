Hello Friends! My name is Lauren Gray! Wife to Tyler Gray, expectant mom to our first little one, John Wylam, and lover of all things beautiful and creative. I love to create, maybe it's the middle child in me, I don't know, but I am always drawn to creativity. I love music, baking, decorating, designing, etc.. so photography was a pretty natural step. I have always loved photography and it has been a true passion of mine since I was a kid. I just never dreamed that the Lord would open the opportunity to turn it into a career, but I am so happy that He did.

My hubs and I live in our dream home, a 1914 Craftsman farmhouse in Eclectic, Alabama. Our house was owned by the town doctor and we have loved learning about his family and how beloved they were to the people of this town. We have loved every minute of being here. This is definitely one of those towns where everybody knows everybody, and someone always knows your business, and honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. There is just something about knowing your neighbors and doing life together with them. 

I could definitely never write a bio and not introducing our fur babies, Fred and Eleanor.

Lastly, here are 5 random facts about me...

1. I am a coffee lover, and kinda a coffee snob to be honest. One of the hardest things about pregnancy has been giving up my daily coffee from our local coffee shop! 
2. I love winter and the snow, I am definitely more of a Fall & Winter person (which I know sounds insane since I live in Alabama where it is basically summer 9 months of the year)
3. I majored in Music (vocal performance) in college and have taught Elementary music, as well as private voice and piano for 5 years. I am a complete music nerd. 
4. I love to travel but have never actually been oversees. My dream is to visit Europe and just see everything. Probably top of the list would be Ireland, Rome, and the French countryside. 
5. Ok one more... My husband and I were both homeschooled.  Yes, we were those weird homeschool kids. We met randomly my senior year of high school in Walmart (yes you read that right), and the rest was history.
